        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These crispy oven-baked kale chips are a great homemade snack. You cannot stop at just eating one, just like potato chips. Great for parties, too.</p>
        <h3 class="subsection">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 bunch kale</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="subsection">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>With a knife or kitchen shears carefully remove kale leaves from the thick stems and tear into bite size pieces. Wash and thoroughly dry kale with a salad spinner. Drizzle kale leaves with olive oil and toss to combine. Spread out in an even layer on the baking sheet without overlapping and sprinkle with salt.</li>
            <li>Bake until the edges start to brown but are not burnt, 20 to 30 minutes</li>
        </ol>
